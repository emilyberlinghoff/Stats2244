## Question 1
Based on the research question, the **population** of interest is school-aged children.

## Question 2

### Part A
The specific **sampling frame** I will use is school-aged children who attend elementary schools in Massachusetts because I am a researcher at Harvard University in Massachusetts. 

### Part B
A positive consequence related to **representativeness** is that since we are studying children that attend school are in the school system, we have access to the entire population amount, and we can choose how many children from each age school to be proportional to the entire state of Massachusetts. A negative consequence related to the **generalizability** of children aged 6-12 who attend elementary school is that we're leaving out children of that age who do not attend elementary school. Some examples of these **outliers** are those who are homeschooled, those who do their schooling online, and/or those who are part of an athletic program that prevents them from going to a regular elementary school. Specifically with the latter outlier, these would probably be more flexible than the children who attend regular elementary school due to their high level of athleticism. 

## Question 3

### Part A
The **sampling design** I would like to use is **multi-stage sampling**. In the first stage, I will use **voluntary response sampling** with a **survey**, because this is probably the easiest way to get a lot of data upfront. In the survey, I'll just ask simple questions, one of which is about their screen time. In the next stage, I'll use **stratified sampling** with the different **stratas** being separated based on screen time and also age.

### Part B
The end goal is to have an equal amount of **units** for each range of screen time, for each age 6 through 12. By comparing the averages of each stratum, we can see any **correlation** between screen time and flexibility, while ensuring that age doesn't influence the data.

## Question 4
Just like how a chain is as strong as its weakest link, the strata will be as big as its smallest strata. Since the sampling design relies on volunteers to participate, there could be any number of participants, and each stratum should have the same amount in the end. For example, if only 5 7-year-olds with a screen time of 5-6 hours submit a survey, each stratum can only be 5 units large. This can make the overall study population very small.
