1. Based on the research question, the population on interest is school-aged children.

2. 
    a. The specific sampling frame I will use is school-aged children that attend elementary schools in Massachusetts, because I am a researcher at Harvard University in Massachusetts. 

    b. A positive consequence related to representativeness is that since we are studying chilren that attend school are in the school system, so we have access to the entire population amount, and we can choose how many children from each age school to be proprtional to the entire state of Massachusetts. A negative consequence related to generalizability of children aged 6-12 that attend elementary school is that we're leaving out children of that age that do not attend elementary school. Some examples of these outliers are those that are homeschooled, those that do their schooling online, and/or those that are part of an atheltic program that prevent them from going to a regular elementary school. Specificially with the latter outlier, these would probably be more flexible than the children who attend regular elementary school due to their high level of athleticism. 

3. 
    a. The sampling design I would like to use is multi-stage sampling. In the first stage, I will use voluntary response sampling with a survey, because this is probably the easiest way to get a lot of data up front. In the surey, I'll just ask simple questions, one of which being their screen time. In the next stage, I'll use stratified sampling with the different stratas being separated based on screen time and also age.

    b. The end goal is to have an equal amount of units for each range of screen time, for each age 6 through 12. By comparing the averages of each strata, we can see any correlation between screen time and flexibilty, while making sure that age doens't influence the data.

4. Just like how a chain is as strong as it's weakest link, the stratas will be as big as it's smallest strata. Since the sampling design relies of volunteers to pariticpate, there could be any number of pariticpants, and each strata should have the same amount in the end. For example, if only 5 7-year-olds with a screen time of 5-6 hours submit a survey, each strata can only be 5 units large. This can maket the overall study population very small.
