# Importing the data
Check out my GitHub for the full code [*here*](https://github.com/emilyberlinghoff/Stats2244-Assignment-2).
```{r Importing Data, echo=TRUE}
# I've used R and Python for quantum computing before so I'm gonna use things we didn't learn in class for my own practice.
a2 <-  read.csv("assign.csv")
library(ggplot2)
library(rmarkdown)
```

# Question 1  

## Part a  
The *explanatory variables* based on the research question are the **sex** and **screen**. We observe both of these variables to see how they affect the *response variable* of **physical**. 

## Part b  
The variables in the dataset I will use to answer the research question are **sex**, **screen**, and **tilt**. 

## Part c  
The *categorical variable* is **sex**. The *qualitative variables* are **screen** and **tilt**.

# Question 2  


```{r Graph, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(a2, aes(x=screen, y=tilt, color=sex)) + # making x and y axis
    geom_point(size=2, shape=20, alpha=0.5) + # making the points
    geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE, aes(group=sex)) + # add linear trend lines without the confidence interval
    labs(title="Relationship Between Screen Time and Flexibility by Sex", x="Screen Time (hours/day)", y="Tilt (degrees)", color="Sex") +
    theme_minimal() + # making it look nicer
    scale_color_manual(values=c("pink","blue")) # blue for male and pink for female

```
