BIOL/STATS 2244
Assignment 1: Problem and Plan
Objectives
This Assignment is designed to demonstrate your current mastery of concepts related to the following
course-level Learning Outcomes (these are pulled directly from the course syllabus, page 4):
i. Communicate statistical concepts, analyses, and arguments in an accurate and scholarly
manner;
a. Apply vocabulary to describe statistical concepts, procedures, and ideas;
b. Justify the choice of statistical procedures (e.g. selected study designs) when
considering data quality and generalizability;
ii. Design sampling and/or study procedures to collect relevant data addressing a research
question;
a. Identify issues associated with sampling and/or study design (such as bias,
undercoverage, confounding, control, reproducibility).
To achieve these objectives, you will need to draw on course material from Topic 2: PPDAC: a Scientific
Inquiry Framework, and Topic 3: Sampling Designs & Considerations.
How this Assignment ‘works’
This Assignment is the first of three (3) Assignments in the course. The three Assignments are designed to
sequentially progress through the PPDAC Framework; this first Assignment involves elements from the
Problem and Plan stage of PPDAC; the second Assignment focuses on the Data stage, and the last
Assignment moves to the Analysis and possibly, Conclusion stage. This first Assignment has a lot of
information, as it aims to familiarize you with the nature of Assignments and some general information
that will be relevant for future Assignments.
The section below, Research Background is meant to briefly emulate the type of literature review or
context that a researcher would conduct when initially setting up a research program. That is, it provides
background to understand the main vocabulary and motivation for the field of study, i.e. providing you
sufficient knowledge on the topic to understand the Research Question. The background should provide
you with ideas or keywords that you could use if you wish to do some further research to help you
complete this Assignment, but additional research is not required (nor is there incentive to do so). If you
do conduct additional research and subsequently use that information explicitly in your Assignment, you
should include a References list at the end of your Assignment (which doesn’t contribute to your word
count), and use a proper in-text citation style of your choice (e.g. APA, footnotes, following your ‘favourite’
citation format, etc). Again, there is NO expectation that you do any additional research to complete the
Assignments in this course.

The Research Prompt will provide you with an Objective that serves as a broad connecting ‘theme’ for the
three Assignments in the course. Each Assignment will deal with a different Research Question that relates
in some way to the Objective. The Research Questions will change from Assignment to Assignment; I do
this so we can explore different types of questions, and also to help keep the content being evaluated on
each Assignment reasonably independent. Having an overarching Objective is quite common; researchers
often have interest in a particular field, and then conduct research projects that address different
questions or concepts contributing to that objective; the idea of having different Research Questions
across our three Assignments also emulates that idea.
For this Assignment, you will take on the role of a researcher at a University of your choice, who has a
research program described in the Research Prompt. You are starting the process of designing a new
study to collect data to answer a Research Question.
This is still an Assignment in Biol/Stat 2244; you are trying to demonstrate your mastery of
2244 learning outcomes. This Assignment will be graded based on the degree to which your
submission meets the criteria listed in the Grading for Assignment 1 section of this file.
Consequently, while you are free to be creative as the “researcher” and use your personal
experience/critical thinking to address aspects of the Assignment Questions, always keep in
mind that you are trying to demonstrate what you have learned in Biology/Statistics 2244.
Research Background
Life has changed dramatically in the last few decades. Where previously TVs and microwaves were
luxury items, they are now household staples. The internet was effectively unheard of by the layperson
40 years ago; it’s now available at our fingertips (i.e. smartphones) effectively 24-hours each day.
Changes in society and technology have made the experience of growing up now quite different from
our predecessors. Even since the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the frequency and type of screentime—that
is, time that individuals spend on smartphones, the internet, tablets, watching TV, playing video games,
etc.—has changed1
. Where outdoor and athletic activities were the main focus of childhood recreation
in the 1980s/1990s, now children have access to other opportunities, such as summer camps focused on
computer programming (for example). Of course, children growing up now continue to engage in
athletic activities, but the focus on organized and competitive sports has increased.
We are still building our understanding of how technology, modern life, and changes in societal values of
what childhood should entail influence the mental and physical well-being of kids. Recent research has
focused on the relationships between screen time and physical activity2, sleeping habits3
, and mental
health4
. But, there is less recent information about the interactions between those variables and
physical attributes like growth (e.g. timing of puberty, growth rate of muscles and limbs, etc.), flexibility
(e.g. ability to bend joints or stretch), and strength (e.g. capacity to lift/hold/move weight) of children.
Poor or reduced childhood physical attributes could be risk factors for health issues later in life.

Consequently, understanding factors that influence the health and physical attributes of children could
promote greater knowledge of factors affecting or contributing to health in adulthood.
Research Prompt
You are a researcher with at University “X” (whatever university you want—it’s not particularly
important). You regularly collaborate with other researchers at your university (and potentially
elsewhere), including those who work with and conduct research on child development (physical and
mental), as well as psychology. Your research interests and expertise lie in the physical health of
children.
You have a research lab (with graduate students and research fellows who can help you with your
research, e.g. as individuals helping to collect data if necessary) with funding that you are using to
conduct a variety of research studies that all relate to the following objective:
Understand modern factors that influence physical attributes and health of children.

Assignment Questions
For the purpose of this Assignment, you (the researcher) have an observational study planned that will
address the following Research Question:
Is there a relationship between daily screen time and physical flexibility of school-
aged children?6
You already have the details of your observational study determined; it requires that you have
participants who will dedicate a few hours to come to a location where you can make your
observations/take measurements. Keep these details in mind as you answer the Assignment Questions
below.
1. What is the population of interest based on the Research Question?
2. (a) State the specific sampling frame that you will use.
(b) Briefly discuss a positive and a negative consequence related to representativeness (i.e.
generalizability) of your selected sampling frame to the population of interest. Be sure your
discussion is always connected/relevant to the Research Question.
3. (a) Describe the sampling design that you will use to obtain a representative sample for this
Research Question; your description should provide an overview of how the design will be
implemented. (b) In your description, provide a clear explanation (i.e. justify your choice) of why
you chose that particular sampling design, including why the approach and choices you made
are relevant/necessary for the Research Question.
4. Briefly discuss one downfall/disadvantage in terms of representativeness of the sample that
results from the sampling design (not the sampling frame) you proposed. This downfall should
not overlap with your answer in part b. Don’t superficially create a downfall in your sampling
design to answer this question!
5 Remember, this objective is just the overarching theme that links all three Assignments in 2244 together. For
THIS Assignment 1, focus on the Research Question provided in the next section.
6 School-aged children are considered between the ages of 6-12 years.

IMPORTANT!
When answering these Assignment questions, keep in mind that you should always prioritize
quality of the resulting data you will get from your sample. As well, don’t superficially make
a downfall in your sampling design to simply answer the questions about negative
consequences (Q1b) or downfalls (Q4). Your really should design the best overall sampling
(from sampling frame through sampling design) possible. Then, think critically about where
the downfall/negative consequences lie.
In essence, as you make choices in your sampling frame and sampling design, keep quality
data (i.e. representativeness) at the forefront of your decisions, and then moderate to be
somewhat realistic (i.e. based on common sense experience on what will be ‘possible’ and
what information may be available to you).
Try to keep your entire Assignment to around 400 words or fewer; we won’t be marking word count per
se, so going over isn’t an issue and shouldn’t be used as a justification for not explaining your answers
fully. The suggested word count is to give you a sense of potential detail for the average response.
Sampling designs that are quite complicated (in Q3) may require more text to explain/justify; we
understand that.
Grading for Assignment 1
For this Assignment, there may be several potential ways to answer Questions 2, 3, and 4. This is meant
to emulate working in science: there will often be many ways to Plan a sampling design to obtain a
sample relevant to a Research Question and population of interest. However, that does not mean that
all research Plans are equally good or feasible. We must think about, and balance, the competing
pressures and constraints on research (e.g. resource availability, accessibility, the nature of and access
to our study units, etc.) with a prioritization for “good quality” data; in the context of this Assignment,
that means focusing on a representative sample whose data will generalize well to the population of
interest. We must also think about communicating our Plan clearly in a way that makes other individuals
understand the choices we’ve made, why they are appropriate, and ultimately, could visualize/
understand how the sampling is being conducted.
General Overview of Grading
Your answers to the Assignment Questions will be graded based on a 4-level rubric (on page 8), which
focuses on your mastery of several course-level learning outcomes. When the graded Assignment is
returned to you, you will receive three categories that indicate which level on the rubric your
submission received for the three Learning Outcomes being evaluated. As an example, you might
receive:
• Proficiency for “Vocabulary”, indicating that your submission demonstrated proficiency for the
learning outcome, “Apply vocabulary to describe statistical concepts, procedures, and ideas;
distinguish among common sampling designs”, and,
• Mastery for “Justification”, indicating your submission demonstrated mastery of the learning
outcome, “Justify the choice of statistical procedures”, and,
Biol/Stat 2244B FW23

5
• Approaching Proficiency for “Quality”, indicating your submission demonstrated approaching
proficiency of the learning outcome, “Identify issues associated with sampling design”
You will be able to see these three levels and some feedback about them through Gradescope when the
graded Assignment is returned. These levels will also be communicated in OWL Brightspace Gradebook
entry for Assignment 1. To be clear, there will be NO numeric mark for the Assignment (e.g. like 75% or
8/10, etc.); the three assigned levels are the only outcome of the evaluation.
Essential Requirements and Late/Accommodated Assignments
• Failure to submit the Assignment at all will result in a ‘0’ for the Assignment unless Academic
Consideration from the Academic Counseling office of your home Faculty is received.
• Completion of all three (3) Assignments AND earning at least 5 level P and no more than 2 level
N across all three Assignments (each of which evaluate you on three (3) learning outcomes) is
part of the ‘Essential Requirements’ to be eligible to earn credit (i.e. 50% or higher as a final
course grade) for the course. Failing to meet the Essential Requirements with respect to
Assignments will result in a final course grade recorded as 40% (or, your calculated course
grade—whichever is lower). This is detailed in the course syllabus, page 7.
• Late Assignments (i.e. beyond the 48-hour grace period on the official deadline, and without
academic consideration from your home Faculty’s Academic Counseling unit) will be accepted
with a late penalty, equivalent to ONE (1) rubric level) for one learning outcome (taken from the
learning outcome graded at the highest level, to minimize overall impact) per 24 hours or part
thereof. For reference, this is a pretty steep late penalty; it is in your best interest to not submit
after the 48-h grace period closes at 11:55 pm on the relevant Sunday. If you decide to submit
late, simply upload your submission as you normally would. The date/time of upload will be
used as the date to compute any late penalty. Note that you will not be able to upload more
than three (3) days after the end of the 48-h grace period without academic consideration.
• If academic consideration is received from your Faculty’s Academic Counseling office, with the
consideration covering the deadline for the Assignment, arrangements should be made with
Jennifer Peter (through email; be sure to put 2244B in the subject line of your email). In general,
you are advised to continue to work on the Assignment (if you are physically/mentally able to)
while you wait for Counseling to review your request for consideration. You can and should also
submit your Assignment during that time if you are prepared to do so. In situations where
extended academic consideration is required, you and Jennifer will work together to find an
appropriate method for completion of the Assignment.
Requests for clarification or review of grading
The graders work very hard with the rubric and training to grade your Assignment accurately and
consistently. Occasionally, mistakes can happen—especially in a large course. If, after you’ve received
your graded Assignment back, and have carefully reviewed your lecture notes and feedback on the
Assignment, you need clarification on some aspect of the grading, then the process to make that
request is done through Gradescope (not email or in Student Hours, etc.). After the graded Assignment
is returned, there will be a one-week opportunity to “Request Regrade” through Gradescope. This is
achieved by clicking on your Assignment submission, and then choosing the button for Request Regrade
(for the ‘Entire submission’). This is the only method through which requests for regrades will be
accepted. Jennifer and graders will not respond to regrade requests through any other form (e.g. email,
OWL Discussions, Student Hours, etc.).

When you make your request, you should be polite and clear about which aspect(s) of your Assignment
you are seeking clarification/consideration for. Extended explanations or elaborations generally aren’t
needed, as we grade only what is submitted in the original Assignment. Our grader will review your
concern, and address it. Note that we will have to review your entire submission during a regrade
(because the grading rubric is holistic rather than question specific). While it is generally a rare outcome,
it is possible for a regrade to result in a lower rubric level for some aspect of the assignment. Note that it
will take some time for the request to be addressed as the graders have multiple responsibilities to
manage; please be patient.
Format of Assignment 1
Structure of your Assignment answers
You will be working with R markdown files (the focus of Lab 3) as you move forward in this course on the
Assignments and possibly some Activities. This Assignment is a good opportunity to show some basic
proficiency in using R markdown (it will save you some pain in the future!). Consequently, I strongly
encourage (but don’t require) you to:
• write your entire Assignment in an R markdown file, and knit it to PDF for submission, or, knit it
to Word and then save the corresponding Word file as a PDF for submission
• use markdown formatting to create ‘headings’ to separate the different parts of the assignment
(for example, a heading for “Question 1” could be used)
• use markdown formatting to bold the vocabulary terms that you integrate into your
assignment.
Aside from those suggestions, mark sure that your Assignment—in whatever file format you use—meets
the following format requirements:
✓ submitted as a single .PDF file. The text in your PDF file must be readable by a screen reader
(i.e. your file should not be images of text saved into a PDF). It’s a good idea to keep the
filename fairly simple. I find it helpful if you put your userID (e.g. jsmith123) in the file name, but
this is not explicitly required. Here’s an example of a helpful filename: Assignment 1 – jsmith123
✓ Do NOT include the original Assignment questions. Your Assignment will be submitted to
Turnitin; having the Assignment question text in your submission will inflate the observed
textual similarity. If you like having the questions in your file as you write, that’s fine; just delete
them before you submit.
✓ Write in complete sentences and organize your answer into logical paragraphs, if appropriate.
✓ As mentioned above, separate your answers for Questions 1, 2, 3, and 4 with headings so we
know which parts of the Assignment you are addressing.
✓ Please use single spacing (or 1.5 line spacing which tends to be a default in Microsoft Word);
avoid double spacing (double spacing is challenging to read in digital format).
✓ Do your best to use proper grammar and spelling. While there is no grade/mark for grammar
and spelling, problems with sentence structure and grammar that impact readability may make
it difficult for the grader to understand what you “mean” to say and award proper credit for
your work. We grade what is written.
✓ Write your answer in your own words. This Assignment (and all other work in 2244) is an
individual Assignment, evaluating YOUR application of the course material. Your Assignment will
be submitted to Turnitin for analysis of textual similarity to other sources. If Turnitin raises
concerns about the independence or authenticity of your submitted assignment, the situation

will be dealt with according to the University’s procedures for issues relating to Academic
Integrity. On a related note, you need to comply with the 2244 policy on AI tools (posted on
OWL Gradescope under Topic 1, in the section on “Understanding 2244”).

Apply vocabulary to
describe statistical
concepts, procedures,
and ideas
Answer uses statistical vocabulary (taught in
2244) where the vocabulary applies, and use
is correct in all instances. Population,
sampling frame, and sample are accurately
and consistently distinguished. Sampling
design vocabulary is accurately incorporated
and described. Vocabulary is seamlessly used,
with sufficient detail to demonstrate
understanding, without relying on general
definitions.
Clear attempt to apply statistical
vocabulary where appropriate, except:
minor inaccuracies in vocabulary occur,
and/or, minor absence of relevant
vocabulary for concepts/processes that
are obviously implemented in design,
and/or use of general definitions for
vocabulary to support application.
Vocabulary use and/or answer
suggests misunderstanding or
confusion between/about
major concepts (e.g. sampling
design vs. study design7;
sampling frame vs. sampling
strategy vs. sample), and/or,
multiple inaccuracies in
application of vocabulary.
Little to no attempt to incorporate
statistical vocabulary, and/or,
majority of attempts contain
significant errors that suggest a
misunderstanding of concepts,
and/or, vocabulary use is
predominantly through definitions
rather than integration into the
description of the Research
Question/study.
Justify the choice of
statistical procedures
Justifications provided accurately relate to or
are grounded/relevant to the Research
Question; evident that design would obtain a
sample relevant to the population and
Research Question.
Reason(s) for choices made/ approaches used
throughout the Assignment are justified and
complete.
Justifications provided accurately relate to
or are grounded/relevant to the Research
Question; evident that design would
obtain a relevant sample except: some
minor aspect(s) of the design/choices
made is/are not justified, and/or, some
design components appear arbitrary,
and/or, design incorporates components
not relevant to the population and/or
Research Question.
Some aspects of design do not
adequately relate to the
population and/or Research
Question/context, and/or
multiple aspect(s) of the
design/choices are not
effectively justified.
Choices for design do not
adequately relate to the population
and Research Question/ context
and/or justification effectively
absent.
Identify issues
associated with
sampling design
Demonstrates an accurate understanding of
and application of course concepts related to
‘quality’ of sampling decisions for both the
sampling frame and sampling strategies.
Discussion of quality concerns are specific and
connect to the Research Question. Evident
prioritization of representative and
generalizable sample data.
Evident attempt to apply an
understanding of and application of
course concepts related to ‘quality’,
except: some applications suggest a
misunderstanding/misapplication of a
concept, and/or, some applications are
trivially/generically addressed.
Application of course concepts
related to ‘quality’ are
primarily trivial/generic,
and/or, design choices do not
prioritize a quality sample,
and/or, discussion suggests
significant misunderstanding of
concepts related to quality.
Little to no attempt to apply course
concepts related to quality of
sampling decisions.
7 This Assignment is NOT about study design, but responses that include content about study design in a manner that suggest confusion about the distinction between sampling
and study design, or, that inappropriately focus on study design to answer the Assignment questions, would result in level A.
